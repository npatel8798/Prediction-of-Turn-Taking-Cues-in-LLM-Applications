## Prediction of Turn Taking Cues in LLM Applications
**About the Project**
<p align = "justify">
The primary objective of this project is to reviewed the TurnGPT to determine how to apply this to Llama2 models. We leveraged an approach to classify sentences as potential TRPs that can be incorporated into any LLM using a agent based services. This project is a part of Natural language Processing course under the guidance of Prof Frank Ferraro (UMBC).
